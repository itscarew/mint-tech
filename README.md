## Feedback

Duplicating DOM elements and populating them with random data causes an unnecessary increase in development time. Though it's not difficult or stressful, it would be better if candidates could dynamically populate the DOM.

An API or a JSON file that provides data would be ideal.

It would reduce development time and also give you (the recruiter) more insight to the candidates' technical skills. 

Thank You
